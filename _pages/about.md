Hi, I’m Tirth, a Mechanical Engineer from New Zealand who specializes in mechanical systems and design, computer-aided design (CAD), simulation, prototyping, and testing and validation. With a strong passion for innovation, I thrive in environments that blend creative problem-solving with technical precision.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of exciting projects in research and development, specifically in soft robotics, as well as product development in electro-mechanical design. My experience extends to systems engineering, where I’ve contributed to the development of reliable, high-performance products that meet both technical and user requirements.

I’m driven by a deep curiosity to learn and an adaptable mindset that allows me to navigate new challenges and technologies with ease. Whether it's diving into new fields or refining existing processes, I approach every project with an open mind and a determination to grow. I take pride in bringing ideas to life through hands-on prototyping, rigorous testing, and iterative design, always aiming to deliver solutions that are both functional, scalable and reliable! 

Whether working individually or as part of a team, I’m committed to making meaningful contributions to every project I take on. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, explore my projects page or feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
