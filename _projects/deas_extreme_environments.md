This research project, which formed the basis of my master’s thesis, explores the performance of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) under extreme environmental conditions. I conducted extensive testing—including thermal, vacuum, and fatigue experiments—to evaluate how temperature, pressure, and repeated cycling affect actuator behavior, reliability, and material integrity. The goal was to assess the feasibility of DEA-based soft robotic systems for space and harsh terrestrial applications. A publication based on this work is currently in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
