<div style="text-align: justify;">
In this project, I designed and built a custom testing rig to evaluate the performance of various electroadhesion pad configurations. By systematically varying substrate, electrode, and dielectric materials, I tested multiple pad samples against both conductive and insulating target surfaces. The pads were fabricated using a range of manufacturing techniques, including conductive ink printing, stamping, brushing, and sputtering, to study their impact on adhesion performance. The results, presented in comparative plots, reveal how material and fabrication choices influence adhesion strength and reliability. A figure of the testing setup is included to illustrate the experimental methodology.
