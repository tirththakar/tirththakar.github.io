<div style="text-align: justify;">
I designed a complete 3D CAD assembly of a game controller using SolidWorks, featuring both the top and bottom housings along with placeholders for joysticks, buttons, and a PCB. To ensure mechanical strength and manufacturability, I integrated internal ribs and support structures. The model utilized advanced SolidWorks tools such as shelling, complex surface modeling, and part interlocks. Exploded views of the assembly are included to clearly illustrate the internal layout and component integration.
