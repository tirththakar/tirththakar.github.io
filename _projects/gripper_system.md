<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project involved the design and fabrication of a soft robotic gripping end effector powered by dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). The gripper demonstrates reliable, reversible actuation, as shown in a video highlighting the deformation response of the DEA elements. Integrated onto a robotic arm, the end effector successfully manipulates and transports objects between locations, showcasing its potential for lightweight and adaptable robotic handling applications. A demonstration video captures the full manipulation sequence.
