This project involved the end-to-end design of a high-altitude balloon payload system intended to carry dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) into the stratosphere for environmental testing under near-space conditions. The system is designed for a 6-hour flight reaching an altitude of approximately 80,000 feet, exposing the DEAs to extreme thermal and pressure environments. I led the systems-level design of the payload, which is divided into three distinct compartments: an insulated electronics bay to maintain safe operating temperatures for onboard control systems; a “hot” compartment exposed to direct sunlight to simulate high-temperature conditions; and a “cold” compartment shielded from solar radiation and thermally insulated to drive down internal temperatures. I developed custom fixtures and housings for each DEA test module and all onboard components, ensuring mechanical stability and thermal isolation between compartments. The entire payload was modeled in CAD, with detailed engineering drawings created for fabrication. I also designed and built the electrical system, including custom PCBs and power regulation circuits, which will be shown through schematics and photos of the completed hardware. This project demonstrates a fully integrated approach to mechanical, electrical, and environmental system design for soft robotics testing in extreme atmospheric conditions.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
