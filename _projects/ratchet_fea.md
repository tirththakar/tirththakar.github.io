<div style="text-align: justify;">
In this project, I modeled a ratchet wrench in SolidWorks and performed a structural simulation using ANSYS to evaluate its mechanical performance under load. A force was applied to the handle end to simulate real-world usage, and the resulting stress, strain, and deformation distributions were analyzed. The study helped identify critical stress regions and validate the design's structural integrity, providing insight into potential material or geometry optimizations.
